---

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- JWT authentication via `--client-id` / `--client-secret` is now the recommended authentication method, taking priority over `--token` when both are provided (#95)

- Documentation updated to establish JWT as the recommended authentication method over Basic auth (#99)

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- AppSec logo branding in CI security scan results

### Fixed

- Support empty `--fail-on` flag for informational-only scans that should never fail the build

### Security

- Defense-in-depth secret masking prevents accidental secret exposure in scan output, proposed fixes, and debug logs

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- JWT/VIPR token authentication with `--client-id`, `--client-secret`, `--auth-endpoint` flags (or `ARMIS_CLIENT_ID`, `ARMIS_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ARMIS_AUTH_ENDPOINT` env vars)
- Automatic JWT token refresh (5 minutes before expiry) with tenant ID auto-extraction from token
- `auth` command for testing authentication and obtaining raw JWT tokens
- Colored terminal output with `--color` flag (`auto`/`always`/`never`) respecting `NO_COLOR` and TTY detection
- `--theme` flag (`auto`/`dark`/`light`) for terminal background override with `ARMIS_THEME` env var
- Background version update checking with 24-hour cache (disable with `--no-update-check` or `ARMIS_NO_UPDATE_CHECK`)

- Styled help output with colored commands and flags
- Short flag aliases: `-f` for `--format`, `-t` for `--token`
- `ARMIS_API_URL` environment variable for API base URL override

### Changed

- Case-insensitive `--fail-on` values (e.g., `--fail-on high` now works)
- JUnit formatter respects `--fail-on` severities instead of hardcoding CRITICAL/HIGH
- Diff display limited to 25 lines per hunk with "lines omitted" markers
- Summary dashboard only shows severity levels with findings (count > 0)
- Clean Ctrl+C handling with exit code 130 (standard Unix SIGINT)
- `--include-files` flag now repo-only (moved from scan-level)
- JWT authentication flags hidden from `--help` until backend support available

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: FAILED scan status now returns error instead of success
- **CRITICAL**: Reject `--exit-code 0` (must be 1-255 to work with `--fail-on`)
- API response limit increased to 50MB for large scan results
- Docker pull/save output redirected to stderr (prevents JSON/SARIF corruption)
- CommitSHA bounds check prevents panic on short commit hashes
- Timeout validation requires >= 1 minute for `--scan-timeout` and `--upload-timeout`
- Unicode text wrapping uses proper visual width calculation
- Rune-based column highlighting for multi-byte characters
- Path/tarball existence validation before network calls

- Improved finding title generation (priority: CVE+package for SCA > OWASP category > secret type > description)

### Changed

- Description truncation edge cases (period handling at position 80, trailing periods)

### Security

- Path traversal protection: skip paths when `util.SanitizePath` fails instead of falling back to original
- Command injection prevention: defense-in-depth image name validation in `exportImage`

---
